# OIKOS

Working title. A colony sim / civ builder that runs from a stone-age founding
band to an advanced financialized civilization, built around an
emergent-economy engine forked from the [praxsim](../praxsim) laboratory.

The design constitution is [`docs/game-spec.md`](docs/game-spec.md)
(revision 2, reviewed). The short version of the pitch: the first colony
builder where the economy is real — prices discovered by actual trades
between colonists, money that *emerges* from barter (a different money good
per map), capital structure that lengthens because colonists actually saved,
and late-game financial crises that follow from the player's own monetary
policy by causal necessity.

## Workspace

```
econ/    the economy engine — fork of praxsim-core (pure std, deterministic)
docs/    the game spec and design documents
```

Future crates per the spec's §4.1: `world/` (map, movement, stockpiles),
`life/` (needs, demography), `content/` (data-driven goods/recipes/tech),
`sim/` (orchestrator, two-rate loop, commands), `ui/` (Bevy client),
`tools/` (headless runners, balance CI). They arrive with their milestones
(G1, G2, …) — empty scaffolding is not kept ahead of need.

## Provenance and the lab relationship

`econ/` was forked at praxsim commit `0729227` (post-M21: the full M0–M21
lab ladder — ordinal value scales, CDA markets, Mengerian money emergence,
banking/fiat/ABCT, the eight-surface tender thread including tax
receivability, and the emergence-robustness instrument with the adopted
M20 envelope). The fork carries the lab's complete test suite as the
engine's **conformance suite**, including the four byte-exact series
goldens (M0/M1/M2/M3) and the M18/M20 emergence goldens — these are the
proof that the fork preserves behavior, and they gate every change to
`econ/` until the engines deliberately diverge (game-spec §10.1).

The praxsim repo stays alive as the clean-room: new economic *mechanisms*
are proven there against its invariant suite, then ported here
(game-spec §13).

## Status: G0a (fork) — in progress

Per game-spec §11:

- [x] fork `praxsim-core` → `econ`; conformance suite green; lab goldens
      replay byte-identical through the fork
- [x] `aggregate_input_goods` O(N²) scan → order-preserving index map
      (identical output by construction; golden-guarded)
- [ ] per-tick provisioning recompute (Concern-5) — DEFERRED: a real
      caching refactor, not a drop-in; belongs with the G2 perf budget
- [ ] tape retention design — DEFERRED to the inspector/WorldView work
      (G2): an in-memory ring buffer changes test-visible tape contents,
      so it is not a behavior-preserving G0a change; the design decision
      is recorded here rather than smuggled in

G0b (dynamic `GoodRegistry`, generational `AgentId` arena, `Command`
result/error semantics — all behind a compat shim) is the next milestone.

## Build and test

```bash
cargo test          # full conformance suite incl. goldens
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```
