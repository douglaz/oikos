//! `sim` — the two-rate orchestrator (G2b) and the multi-settlement region (G2c).
//!
//! G2a built the spatial substrate (`world`) in isolation; G2b makes space
//! **economically meaningful** by wiring it under the economy. `sim` owns a
//! [`world::World`], per-colonist [`life`] need state, and an [`econ::Society`],
//! and runs the **two-rate loop** the game-spec (§4.1, §4.3) calls for: a fast
//! loop of `FAST_TICKS_PER_ECON_TICK` `world` ticks (movement, harvest, haul)
//! under one economic tick (transfer → needs/death → scale regeneration →
//! market clearing → consumption read-back → task reassignment).
//!
//! The milestone proves two things:
//!
//! 1. **Whole-system conservation is exact.** Every physical good is accounted
//!    across its full spatial+economic lifecycle — node stock → hauler carry →
//!    exchange stockpile → econ stock → consumed — with node regen the only
//!    source and consumption the only sink. Goods in transit (a hauler's carry)
//!    are the §4.3 **delivery escrow**: conserved, retained (never destroyed)
//!    when a hauler is blocked or dies.
//! 2. **Distance measurably affects realized prices.** A good gathered from a
//!    node FAR from the exchange realizes a higher price than the same good
//!    gathered NEAR, because travel eats the fast-tick budget so fewer units
//!    reach the market per economic tick (sign only — the lab's
//!    direction-not-magnitude discipline).
//!
//! **The world→econ transfer seam** is the load-bearing design: a good has ONE
//! owner at a time — `world` (node / carry / stockpile) **or** `econ` (agent
//! stock). The econ-tick transfer is the only crossing, and it is net-zero
//! (`world` −n, `econ` +n): delivered exchange-stockpile units are *credited to
//! the depositing colonist's econ stock* and *withdrawn from the world*. If a
//! depositor has no stock headroom yet, the unit stays world-owned in the
//! exchange stockpile and is retried later. See `docs/engine-divergence.md`.
//!
//! `sim` reuses `life`'s `regenerate_scale` / `NeedState` / `CultureParams` /
//! death mechanism and `world` / `econ` as-is, adding only the two additive,
//! conserving accessors that realize the seam ([`world::World::stockpile_withdraw`]
//! and [`econ::society::Society::credit_stock`]). It **supersedes** `life::Camp`
//! as the driver (Camp stays as the G1 non-spatial reference harness).
//!
//! Pure std, integer state, deterministic: the `Rng` is consumed only at
//! [`Settlement::generate`]; neither the fast loop nor the econ tick draws any
//! randomness; iteration is `AgentId`-ordered; storage is `BTreeMap`/`Vec`,
//! never `HashMap`. Same seed + same [`SettlementConfig`] → byte-identical run.
//!
//! ## G2c — multiple settlements that trade (the [`Region`])
//!
//! [`Region`] composes the milestone's final slice **by composition, not internal
//! surgery**: it holds a `Vec<Settlement>`, each one **unchanged** from G2b, linked
//! by an abstract inter-settlement [`Route`] (a transit-tick count), with one
//! caravan carrying a good from where it is cheap to where it is dear.
//! The caravan is a **pair of permanent resident trader agents** (one per linked
//! settlement, created at generation — never a runtime roster change), whose wealth
//! the region shuttles along the route as escrow using the additive, conserving
//! `econ` transfer accessors. Because no `Settlement` and no `Society` internal
//! behaviour changes, the six econ conformance goldens and the whole G1/G2a/G2b/G2d
//! suites stay byte-identical. The region proves region-wide conservation is exact
//! (every good and all gold across all settlements plus the in-transit escrow) and
//! that trade converges prices (the gap narrows versus a no-caravan control — sign
//! only). See [`mod@region`].
//!
//! ## G6a — the era detector ([`mod@era`])
//!
//! [`EraDetector`] is a **read-only** classification of a settlement's institutional
//! era (`Forager → Barter → Money → Specialist → Capital`) from **measured**
//! quantities, with hysteresis — game-spec pillar 2, *"eras are earned, not timed."*
//! It is the engine's *"phase is measured, never set"* doctrine: the era is a derived
//! statistic, not a state the engine sets or a timer advances. It reads only the
//! existing accessors (vocations, the money good, the per-tick report, barter
//! volume), mutates nothing, draws no RNG, holds no `HashMap`, and is imported by **no
//! decision path** (a source-gate, like econ's `metrics`, enforces it) — so a run
//! observed by a detector is byte-identical to one that is not, and the six econ
//! goldens are untouched. The Credit/Modern rungs are deferred to G8 (finance). See
//! [`mod@era`] and `sim/tests/g6a_eras.rs`.
